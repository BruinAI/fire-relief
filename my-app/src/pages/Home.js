            Insurance claimants affected by the January California Wildfires are attempting to submit itemized claims
            for household items lost in the fires. However, many claimants don't know exactly what was in their home, as
            they were unable to evacuate their property. It's also difficult to create an itemized list without
            reviewing years of receipts.
